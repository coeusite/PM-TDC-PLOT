# PM-TDC-PLOT

This project is a mini project that uses Python 3 to create a time-diameter-count plot of particular matters.

In the plot, X-axis refers to time, Y-axis indicates diameter and the color at point (x, y) is the count of particular matters with diameter y at time x.

I would try to 
- follow [Google Python Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) during coding.
- make it interactive (with Flask)
